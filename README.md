# Melbourne Housing Price Prediction

This README file provides a brief overview of a Python script for predicting housing prices in Melbourne using machine learning techniques. The script uses libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn to perform data preprocessing, missing data imputation, feature engineering, and polynomial regression modeling.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed:

   - Pandas
   - Matplotlib
   - scikit-learn

2. Download the Melbourne housing dataset ('Melbourne_housing_FULL.csv') and specify the correct file path in the script.

3. Run the script to perform the following tasks:

   - Load the dataset.
   - Check for missing data and calculate the count of missing values in each column.
   - Impute missing data using appropriate strategies.
   - Split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Handle missing values in features and the target variable.
   - Create polynomial features and train a Polynomial Regression model.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) score.
   - Visualize actual vs. predicted prices (optional).

## File Descriptions

- `Melbourne_housing_FULL.csv`: The dataset containing housing data.
- `housing_price_prediction.py`: The Python script for data preprocessing and modeling.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the script.

## Results

The script generates predictions for housing prices in Melbourne and evaluates the model's performance using MSE and R2 score. Additionally, it identifies and displays mismatched predictions where the model's predictions differ significantly from the actual prices.

## Potential Improvements

To further enhance the model's performance, consider the following:

- Feature engineering: Explore additional features or transformations that may improve prediction accuracy.
- Model selection: Experiment with different regression models (e.g., Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net) or non-linear models.
- Hyperparameter tuning: Adjust hyperparameters, such as the degree of polynomial features.
- Collect more data: Expanding the dataset may lead to more accurate predictions.
- Outlier handling: Identify and handle outliers in the data to mitigate their impact on predictions.

Feel free to adapt and extend this script to suit your specific needs and goals. Happy modeling!
